# Grateful

ah bah hum bug.  i forgot about thanksgiving.  the pilgrims love thanksgiving...  are you so strange i dont understand or is it like a security flaw anything touching me...  and now everyone basically knows about me...  hmm. i should not have done some things i did...  lol...  i wonder i could sit here and do nothing but try to tackle the real issues.  so i learned off the interstellar friend that i have to do this shit.  no running away in the real world.  you will run out of places lol...

so yeah, i'm drained and shit but i smoke up and its still good somehow i am quite amazed.  i dont know though you guys, that i am not doing the right things.  cause i should have been rewarded for my efforts by now...  and you keep bugging me about shit but waste all my time and shit for what?? i dont even know bro.  is it worth that much you run this shit like this???

look dude, i have no brain wash.  after coming here and exerting...  somethings like this.  why did this not get handled properly???

oh well.  i had an idea again but i forgot again.  so things were lost lol.  i dont know bro. i'm getting tired i might start smashing glass...  i wonder sometimes when the time will come...  and you made me do back up thoughts for no reason... crying you die you must be crying wolf again.
