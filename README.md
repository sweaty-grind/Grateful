# Grateful

you know this chase to money i'm starting to recognize the pull it does on you. i wonder these days what you're wondering.  stop gap lol...

i dont know man.  this thing is too much for me.  why?  cause i'm doing dumb stuff.   i dont know man.  its just like this. i wish i could find a better way forward but i dont even know what we just did...

sometimes i can't tell what's going on in the world cause i'm stuck with this shark's burden.  you actually  need this for ptsd????  i dont think so.  but it is???  oh well another reason to almost feel good about yourself.

i dont know man.  i think i should give you the treatment.  you know the one.  when i come up with it eventually lol.  smashing glass anyone?? i just might do it but dont worry about it i  probably will not lol...

so yeah...  i am bored and tired and weeded and fearing and shit.  that y'all bring the old ones back get it??? no? i dont know either.  i wonder how much monees in damages i do and i do not get a piece of it.  i just wondered where the gratefulness of my actions brought about any sort of problem.  i am drained lol.  i just using this boost to get something funny done.  like this problem we have here.  i think i'm immersed already.  boom boom boom.  goes the clouds.. i wonder sometimes, that my efforts were in vain and nothing i did really mattered so i asked you why you don't release so i can go back to playing games...  you know the games make your head tired for once.  you came you fried, i'm damaged.  what can be proven? all of the above. and i still dont do this shit to you.  and another day you say its my fault this happened.

lol.  wtf am i typing sometimes lol....

omg...  what the heck...

OKAY.  I FIGURED IT OUT.  WE JUST TAKE IT FROM YOU...  lolollllloll.  please though, i dont know what i'm doing just ask the shark.  he hears you you know.  lololololool.

okay i figured it out.  we just agree to this extra bit of the end.  since you prefer to not be in the picture i feel a sense of being lost.  but we both know the dirty truth.  just like why you make me do this shit? my head won't shut off.  its like picking up a new illness all the time.  i dont know what to do about it lol.. i know i can see the empty ness and shit but ummm none of it pays the bills.  so such things as giving you this access to me is done on a bother to do something...

yup.  we just tell ourselves they are basking in the results of 5 years of frying me...  i feel some loss of my life or something...  knowing you costed me a decade it feels like.  but about half of that in reality...

so things were what they became.  and we got off on the wrong foot i think you may just be a chicken.  dont want to get exposed or something...  i'm thinking about getting a claim against doing this to me...

you think i'm joking though right??? i sure hope we are on the same foot here.  cause making a mess would destroy my perfect record.  lololol...  it can be run like this to an extent.  i think the shark is real?? i hope he is cause like that was my main job.  taking care of your bitches...  joking right??  how come you don't enjoy getting screwed over by curiosity???  why do it to me if you won't do it to yourselves.  and none of this mattered cause you won't pay me for it.  you are too slow for my tastes i would request an exit here from you cause you caused this mess and i don't want to form compliance with you.  just imagine...  in 3 months time we could have done something great or something.  or i was gonna leave here anyways  lol...

i feel the way you handled me produces a result in me that i cannot comprehend.  you know? i dont.  i've had too much memory loss to do stupid stuff.  so things just stalemated and i told you it was the best time.  in the future conflict also known as practice has to fire on live targets.  we give them all social credit points.  just not over doing it though.  you know???  so thats what i figured what this stupid incessant power hungry asshole you guys are.  you know. you jump up there in space and shit and at a point reality sinks in that you are gonna get screwed really badly.  again...

blah blah something dangerous blah blah.

you know i am currently as to what loss this thing dude.  my mind is jelly.

on the second one...

i dont know what to type lol...  oh wait its ginseng land time...

so i wondered how much of a game you could squeeze into one end huh???  i mean there were too many vectors in here to say things won't hit each other while the float out in space.  just build mother of all bombs nukes...

so you know what i figured out??  that you like me.  cause you play tough guy...  sir, i thought it goes differently and i still hold this view.  you did it so badly that the nation was bankrupt.  somethings like this...

so this is the future and we fixed all the old problems and stupidly we never had a new one cause the leaders say we can't handle it.  when this whole time anything of worth was used up.  nobody here was lame.  i spend my days in this insanity and i figured that i could just do everything while crazy and normal world will still go around.  somethings like this i forgot.

you know, i don't think you really understand what is going on. i bought you more time to do it right.  this is shared goals?? i feel like knowing you guys as solo party makes it weird.  can only proceed with talent to lead the bunch...  somethings like this?? no?

drank my first monster already.  should i grab the second one???
