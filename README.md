i'm tired guys...  have we not have a solution to this issue already??  i wonder sometimes a lot of things.  like wasting my time doing it, and only to see a whole another crapload of crap you would send me on.  i have a problem with you guys though.  you suck.  stop acting like we are super advanced or some shit like that.  we haven't gone very far cause you won't commit.  oh well it is what it is.  i dont know how else to tell you this that i probably could have lived better in a different mindset.  but i'm not up for it...

so yeah,  i think the reality of the situation is that i'm starting to wake up from this hypnosis and the only thing i could tell consistantly was that you waste my time.

smells like alien in here dude.  i can sense it.  its a very simple state and act.  something.  i dont know lol...

no the alien stuff is just another rock bro.  its not that fancy.  we just didn't make nukes that strong.  its foresight is pretty easy to latch on to.  guys.  how come we still doing this shit.  its bugging me a lot.  

oh well i'm outta ideas bro.  we said this once we'll say it again.  you're not getting anything strong.  you seem to enjoy making things depressing.  i wonder dude, this damage you did to me wasn't that bad but it wasn't felt and sensitized to it already.

womp womp...

so i wonder sometimes.  when you gonna play good cop bad cop or you never want to see me again or something like that.  i just wonder why nobody has made the first move and the players dont seem to understand concept of these things.  so it fell on deaf ears and my eyes closed for so many years and things didn't turn out that well...

then you die and you cry. i dont get it bro.  i was serious when i said that.  i need to be serious lol..  its like a thing.  where i just like to do stupid shit all day long and i wonder the price of this existence is the fact i could attack.  but then the natural course of history happens and i eventually get my monees.  but the main fact still exists. this is a mega load of work for not very much reward...

its been so long hmmmm.  probably a condition of living with your microwaves lol...

i dont nkow but i'm waking up righ tnow lol...  what you mean its hard?  hard reward or what?  man its been  a while when i remember how it used to be like.
