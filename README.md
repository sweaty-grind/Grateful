# Grateful

ah bah hum bug.  i forgot about thanksgiving.  the pilgrims love thanksgiving...  are you so strange i dont understand or is it like a security flaw anything touching me...  and now everyone basically knows about me...  hmm. i should not have done some things i did...  lol...  i wonder i could sit here and do nothing but try to tackle the real issues.  so i learned off the interstellar friend that i have to do this shit.  no running away in the real world.  you will run out of places lol...

so yeah, i'm drained and shit but i smoke up and its still good somehow i am quite amazed.  i dont know though you guys, that i am not doing the right things.  cause i should have been rewarded for my efforts by now...  and you keep bugging me about shit but waste all my time and shit for what?? i dont even know bro.  is it worth that much you run this shit like this???

look dude, i have no brain wash.  after coming here and exerting...  somethings like this.  why did this not get handled properly???

oh well.  i had an idea again but i forgot again.  so things were lost lol.  i dont know bro. i'm getting tired i might start smashing glass...  i wonder sometimes when the time will come...  and you made me do back up thoughts for no reason... crying you die you must be crying wolf again.

any reason this stuff takes so damn long and you still decided to do this...  i dont know bro.  the notion of slavery is that i put it on everyone else.  cause the many were not capable of taking care of the one.  so things are lousy and i gave up on so many of them after hanging around you.  for once the shark bothers to log anything.  thats what he behaves like.  like you guys.  always with the burden.  comes to me and then bankrupts my ass.  i dont know bro... i wonder the sanity of reality that i may not have very much left to say.  the act i gave you should like fix shit.  you have my halloween in december i think that was what it was.
