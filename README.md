# Grateful

i'm tired guys...  have we not have a solution to this issue already??  i wonder sometimes a lot of things.  like wasting my time doing it, and only to see a whole another crapload of crap you would send me on.  i have a problem with you guys though.  you suck.  stop acting like we are super advanced or some shit like that.  we haven't gone very far cause you won't commit.  oh well it is what it is.  i dont know how else to tell you this that i probably could have lived better in a different mindset.  but i'm not up for it...

so yeah,  i think the reality of the situation is that i'm starting to wake up from this hypnosis and the only thing i could tell consistantly was that you waste my time.
